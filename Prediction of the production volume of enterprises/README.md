**Goal of the project**: 
to predict heat energy production of definite enterprise so as to improve the quality of statistical data. Different methods of ML are able to predict an indicator for the corresponding date on the basis of historical data. If we have a large deviation of a forecasted value from the real one the data should be returned to correction. The implementation of the methods of Machine learning during the official statistics production can improve the quality of statistical data. 

**Input data:**
Time series of production of heat energy of one anonymized enterprise of the Brest region.
