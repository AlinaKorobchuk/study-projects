| [1.Prediction of the production volume of enterprises](https://github.com/AlinaKorobchuk/study-projects/tree/main/Prediction%20of%20the%20production%20volume%20of%20enterprises) | Time series analysis| Data scientist | Python Pandas Scikit-learn Tensorflow Seaborn Matplotlib Datetime Fbprophet Statsmodels | To predict heat energy production of definite enterprise so as to improve the quality of statistical data | Different methods of ML are able to predict an indicator for the corresponding date on the basis of historical data. If we have a large deviation of a forecasted value from the real one the data should be returned to correction. The implementation of the methods of Machine learning during the official statistics production can improve the quality of statistical data. | Data processing Time series analysis Time series prediction Quality evaluation |
